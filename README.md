# Alibi Checker 

Users can upload location history data from Google. The program converts the location history data into a series of numbers that are anonymous, not stored on any server, and cannot be reverse-engineered to find the user's location history data. 

Officials can use the series of numbers to verify whether the user was at a location a crime was committed.
